# ü™ê Interstellar 

Welcome to **Interstellar**, an app showcasing a limited-edition NFT collection deployed on Soroban (Wasm-based blockchain) and presented through a modern React + TypeScript frontend.
---

## ‚ú® Highlights

- **Built with OpenZeppelin's ERC-721 for Soroban**  
  We're using the new **ERC-721 implementation adapted for Soroban smart contracts** by OpenZeppelin‚Äîpushing forward NFT standards in the Wasm/WebAssembly ecosystem.
- **Inspired by Nouns DAO**  
  The Spacemen concept draws inspiration from [Nouns](https://nouns.wtf), embracing on-chain creativity and public goods through generative art.
- IPFS-hosted NFT metadata, mintable directly by collectors.
- Smart contract compiled to `.wasm` and integrated via Stellar RPC.
- Fully responsive UI built with React + Stellar Design System.
